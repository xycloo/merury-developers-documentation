# Before querying

Before you start querying, remember that you need to have subscriptions in place.

Mercury will not store nor grant you access to data that isn't covered by a subscription.

For example, if you want to index all leder entries for two contracts, you need to perform two [ledger entry subscriptions](./ledger-entries-subscription.md).

Make sure you checked out the [subscriptions](./why-subscriptions.md) chapter.
