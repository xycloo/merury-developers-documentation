# Stellar classic

Mercury allows indexing stellar classic operations throught full account subscriptions. Any operation
that encompasses an account you're subscribed to will be indexed on Mercury, for instance, whether it's your account
that's making the payment or receiving it, Mercury will index the payment.

This is especially useful for wallets looking to integrate Mercury as their source for all Soroban + Stellar data.
